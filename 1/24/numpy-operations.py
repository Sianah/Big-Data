#Rich's print enhances the output with better formatting compared to Python's built-in print.

#Here, element-wise addition is performed between arr and arr2, resulting in arr3. 
#This demonstrates how NumPy supports element-wise operations on arrays of the same shape.
arr3 = arr+arr2
print(arr3)  #prints out the added matrices together

#This line performs an element-wise comparison between arr and arr2. 
#It outputs a boolean array where each element is True if the condition 
#(arr element < arr2 element) is met, and False otherwise.
print(arr < arr2)  # prints out if the elements are less than the other with true and false statements

# broadcasting: make the shapes match by duplicating data
#Broadcasting is a powerful feature in NumPy that automatically expands the dimensions 
#of arrays to make shapes compatible for element-wise operations. 
#Here, [5] is broadcasted to match the shape of arr before addition. 
#This might raise a ValueError because the shapes are not directly compatible for broadcasting.
print(arr + np.array([5])) #in this case, it added 5 to each element in arr

# 5, 4, 3 added to original. Can add things to shape if they can be made to add to shape
#In this case, the 1D array [5, 4, 3] is broadcasted across the rows of arr, 
#meaning each row of arr is added element-wise to [5, 4, 3].
print(arr+np.array([5, 4, 3])) #adds [5 4 3] to each row

# Numpy is based on APL
