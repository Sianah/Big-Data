Plot can have a single value

i.e. Trip distance
 - Histogram or Density graph
 - Histogram (y-axis: count(how many trips), x-axis: miles)
 - Density(y-axis: , x-axis: miles)
 - Histogram is only for one value, not multiple

For multiple values:
 - Can use a bar chart for discrete values
 - Discrete means no fractions. Can have 1 or 2 or 3 things. Continuous can have fractions
 - Even scatter plot can be bad for discrete

For scatter plot:
 - x-axis: total fare, y-axis: distance traveled --> good example for scatter plot. Are continous values

For line chart:
 - x - axis: count , y-axis: each day of september

For radar graph:
 - multiple dimensions that are being compared

For heatmap:
 - 2D version of histograms
 - think of it like checkered boxes where some get filled/colored in

Geographic heatmap:
 - Think of heatmap but in the shape of the United States
